# Dinner Bell - File Description

This document provides a detailed explanation of every file in the Dinner Bell project.

## Root Configuration Files

### `package.json`
Defines the project metadata, dependencies, and npm scripts:
- **Dependencies**: React 18, React DOM, React Router
- **DevDependencies**: TypeScript, Vite, ESLint, and type definitions
- **Scripts**: Development server (`dev`), production build (`build`), linting (`lint`), and preview server (`preview`)
- Configures the project as an ES module with `"type": "module"`

### `package-lock.json`
Automatically generated file that locks exact versions of all dependencies and their sub-dependencies. Ensures consistent installations across different environments.

### `tsconfig.json`
TypeScript configuration for the main source code:
- Targets ES2020 with modern DOM APIs
- Uses bundler module resolution for Vite
- Enables strict type checking and linting rules
- Configures JSX to use React's automatic runtime
- Only includes files in the `src/` directory

### `tsconfig.node.json`
Separate TypeScript configuration specifically for Node.js tooling files (like `vite.config.ts`):
- Targets ES2022 with ES2023 library features
- Uses same strict settings as main config
- Only includes `vite.config.ts`

### `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`
Incremental compilation cache file generated by TypeScript. Speeds up subsequent builds by tracking which files have changed.

### `vite.config.ts`
Vite build tool configuration:
- Imports and configures the React plugin for JSX/TSX support
- Uses Vite's default settings for fast development and optimized production builds

### `vercel.json`
Deployment configuration for Vercel hosting platform:
- Specifies build command, output directory, and framework
- Configures URL rewriting to route all requests to `index.html` (enables client-side routing)

### `.gitignore`
Specifies files and directories Git should ignore:
- Log files and debug output
- `node_modules/` and build artifacts (`dist/`)
- Local environment files (`*.local`)
- Editor-specific files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `.DS_Store`)
- Claude Code configuration (`.claude/`)
- TypeScript build info files

### `PLAN.md`
Comprehensive development roadmap and architecture documentation:
- Technology stack decisions (React, TypeScript, Vite, LocalStorage)
- 9-phase development plan from MVP to advanced features
- Architecture decisions for future backend, recipe parsing, and vision models
- Technical debt tracking and open questions
- Current sprint focus and priorities

### `README.md`
Project overview and getting started guide:
- Feature list (implemented, in progress, planned)
- Tech stack summary
- Installation and development instructions
- Project structure overview
- Links to detailed planning documentation

## Source Files (`src/`)

### `src/main.tsx`
Application entry point:
- Imports React and the root `App` component
- Creates React root and renders the app in Strict Mode
- Attaches to the `#root` DOM element defined in `index.html`
- Imports global styles from `index.css`

### `src/App.tsx`
Main application component:
- Wraps the entire app in `RecipeProvider` for global recipe state
- Renders the header with app title and bell emoji
- Displays `RecipeList` component in the main content area
- Acts as the root layout component

### `src/index.css`
Global CSS styles:
- CSS custom properties for light/dark mode color schemes
- Typography settings (Inter font, line height, font smoothing)
- CSS reset (margin, padding, box-sizing)
- Root container styling with max-width and responsive padding
- Media query for light mode color scheme preference

### `src/vite-env.d.ts`
TypeScript declaration file for Vite-specific types:
- References Vite's client types for import.meta, environment variables, and other Vite features
- Enables TypeScript support for Vite's development environment

## Type Definitions (`src/types/`)

### `src/types/recipe.ts`
Core TypeScript interfaces defining the data models:

- **`Ingredient`**: Structure for recipe ingredients with id, name, amount, and unit
- **`Recipe`**: Complete recipe data model including:
  - Basic info: id, title, servings, dateAdded
  - Cooking details: ingredients, directions, prepTime, cookTime
  - Metadata: sourceUrl, tags, tools, imageUrl, lastMade
- **`RecipeFormData`**: Input type for creating/updating recipes (same as Recipe but without id and dateAdded)

## Context/State Management (`src/contexts/`)

### `src/contexts/RecipeContext.tsx`
Global state management for recipes using React Context API:

- **`RecipeContext`**: React context providing recipe CRUD operations
- **`RecipeProvider`**: Context provider component that:
  - Manages recipe state with `useState`
  - Loads initial recipes from LocalStorage
  - Syncs recipe changes to LocalStorage with `useEffect`
  - Provides methods: `addRecipe`, `updateRecipe`, `deleteRecipe`, `getRecipe`
- **`useRecipes`**: Custom hook for accessing recipe context with error handling
- **Storage**: Uses `localStorage` with key `'dinner-bell-recipes'`
- **ID Generation**: Uses `crypto.randomUUID()` for unique recipe IDs

## Components (`src/components/`)

### `src/components/RecipeList.tsx`
Component for displaying all recipes:
- Consumes recipe data from `useRecipes` hook
- Shows empty state when no recipes exist
- Renders recipe cards in a grid layout
- Displays recipe title, ingredient count, serving count, and tags
- Maps over recipes array to generate individual recipe cards

## HTML Template

### `index.html`
HTML entry point for the application:
- Standard HTML5 document structure
- Sets page title to "Dinner Bell - Recipe Manager"
- Contains `#root` div where React app mounts
- Loads the React application via `<script>` tag pointing to `src/main.tsx`
- Vite processes this file and bundles all dependencies

## Build Output (`dist/`)

### `dist/index.html`
Production build of `index.html` with inlined asset references and optimized for deployment.

### `dist/assets/index-DBkSNr6S.css`
Bundled and minified CSS file containing all application styles. Filename includes content hash for cache busting.

### `dist/assets/index-Pb6MxVrV.js`
Bundled and minified JavaScript file containing the entire React application and dependencies. Filename includes content hash for cache busting.

**Note**: The `dist/` directory is generated by running `npm run build` and should not be manually edited. It's deployed to hosting platforms like Vercel.

## Claude Code Configuration

### `.claude/settings.local.json`
Local settings for Claude Code CLI tool. Contains project-specific configuration for AI-assisted development workflows.

## Summary

The Dinner Bell project follows a clean, modular React architecture:

1. **Entry Flow**: `index.html` → `main.tsx` → `App.tsx`
2. **State**: Centralized in `RecipeContext.tsx` with LocalStorage persistence
3. **Types**: Strongly typed with TypeScript interfaces in `types/`
4. **Components**: Reusable UI components in `components/`
5. **Configuration**: Vite for bundling, TypeScript for type safety, Vercel for deployment
6. **Planning**: Comprehensive roadmap in `PLAN.md` guiding development from MVP to advanced features
